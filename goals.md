What I need HTML and javascript to do : 
- Dynamic routing.
- Keeping state between routes / Sharing data || state between routes.
- Managing interactions that HTML can't manage.
- Reusing components ?..
I got :
- Static pages.
- Dynamic Pages / With element that recieve data.
- Elements that send data.
- Size of files that I send.
- The time that it takes the browser to render a page, from a set of files. i.e. : 
  - Is an HTML file lighter than a javascript file ? If so, should send only html.
  - The other way around ? In that case, how long does it take the browser to parse the javascript ?
