		<h1> About </h1>
		<p>
			During nearly a decade at Amazon, I worked on a wide variety of projects including a petabyte-scale
			customer analytics cluster, an airport for drones, computer vision labeling tools, an open-source smart
			home specification, and even fitness watch firmware. None of these projects were inherently rooted in
			client-side web dynamism, but each of them had some facet that eventually involved JavaScript, either
			by necessity or by virtue of it being the best tool for the job.
